# COVID-19-Screening-App

I developed this app in August 2020 to streamline COVID case management for Town of Orange Elementary Schools. The app would give students a daily survey to fill out regarding their symptoms, and if needed, automatically notify principals, teachers, and nurses of at-risk students. I worked directly with the Town of Orange Health Director. Unfortunately the app was limited due to the townâ€™s lack of HIPAA insurance.
